        <h3>I specialize in building full-stack web applications using technologies like React.js, Next.js, NestJS, and the MERN stack. With a strong focus on performance and usability, I build seamless user experiences using Tailwind CSS, Ant Design, and Bootstrap.
Over the years, I've contributed to several impactful projects — including a villa booking platform integrated with Stripe, Firebase, Google APIs, and real-time WebSocket updates, and a ticketing app featuring live bidding, PayPal payments, and automated notifications via Twilio and SendGrid.
I take pride in writing clean, modular code, building scalable backend systems using Express, NestJS, TypeORM, and MySQL, and delivering feature-rich frontend solutions. Whether it's fixing bugs, creating reusable components, or turning Figma designs into pixel-perfect UIs, I strive to make every product better than before.
